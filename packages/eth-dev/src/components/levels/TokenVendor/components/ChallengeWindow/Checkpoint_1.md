## Checkpoint 1: 🔭 Environment 📺

You'll have three terminals up for:
<br/>
<br/>

`yarn chain` (hardhat backend)

`yarn start` (react app frontend)

`yarn deploy` (to compile, deploy, and publish your contracts to the frontend)

<br/>
> 👀 Visit your frontend at http://localhost:3000
<br/>
<br/>
> 👩‍💻 Rerun `yarn deploy --reset` whenever you want to deploy new contracts to the frontend.
<br/>
> Ignore any warnings, we'll get to that...
